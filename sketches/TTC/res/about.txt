ABOUT

a very experimental text recorder (the first in a long series of chronotext devices?)

particularities:
- tree structure.
- curvature of the medium affected by type rate.

utility: close to null *

(*) except in the context of epistemology, surrealism and/or poetry...


HELP

when recording:

- use the "enter" key to create a new branch.

- use the left/right arrow keys to navigate between branches.

- alternatively, use the history bar at the bottom to switch between the last edited branches.

- intentionally, it is not possible to pause while recording (i.e. capturing the whole process is the key...)
